# Blackjack

This is a simple implementation of the classic game of Blackjack.  It was done as a learning exercise to solidify core JS concepts and patterns.  I wouldnâ€™t categorize it as production ready as there are number of things that still need to be done.  

* code clean up 
* better error handline
* more robust testing 


## built With

* Bootstrap 
* jQuery
